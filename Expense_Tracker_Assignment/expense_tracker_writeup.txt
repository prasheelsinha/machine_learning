Requirement: To create an expense tracker application that will help the user to manage the monthly expenses and store it in a csv file so that user can re-visit the expenses and manage the expenditure accordingly.

Design: The user is provided by an interactive-menu where the user can choose to add, view, track, and save the expenses. A single expense will be stored in the form of a dictionary and this dictionary will be maintained in a list. So, each item in the list will be a dictionary that will give the view of a single expense. The expense dictionary contains the following details: a. The date of expense. b. The category of the expense. c. The amount. d. Description. There are no validations on the fields but any field left blank in an expense will not be displayed to the user once the user selects the view option. Only a warning message for the invalid expense will be displayed along with the description of the expense. The storage for the expense tracker is a csv file which gets loaded everytime the user opens the expense tracker application so that user can have a complete view of all the expenses he/she has done up until now. User can also see the remaining monthly budget by choosing the "Track Budget" option and then providing the desired monthly budget. If user has not crossed the limit then the remaining budget will be displayed otherwise a warning message will be displayed to the user.
